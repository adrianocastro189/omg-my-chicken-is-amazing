# OMG! My Chicken is amazing!

A very simple World of Warcraft addon to always remind players to summon their 
Westfall chicken. It was created to serve as a proof of concept for the new
inventory tracking structure introduced in [Stormwind Library v1.4.0](https://github.com/adrianocastro189/stormwind-library/releases/tag/1.4.0).

Although created as an experiment, the addon will probably be polished to serve
as a real mod for the game. Only time will tell.

## What's on the roadmap for the next versions

* **Support to all client versions:** Cataclysm Classic and Retail

player's inventory, bank or in the pet journal
* **Fun interactions:** Add some fun interactions with the chicken, to be 
clarified in the future
